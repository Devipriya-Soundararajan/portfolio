        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
          I’m Devipriya Soundararajan, a passionate and detail-oriented Full-Stack Software Developer with a strong foundation in both frontend and backend technologies. I specialize in building responsive, user-friendly web applications using tools like JavaScript, React.js, Java, and MySQL.
My journey into tech began with a Bachelor's degree in Information Technology from India, followed by hands-on industry experience at Tata Consultancy Services as an Assistant System Engineer. During my time there, I gained exposure to real-world project workflows, version control practices, and modern development stacks.
Driven by a desire to grow and explore full-stack development in depth, I moved to Canada to pursue a Post-Graduate Diploma in Full-Stack Software Development at Lambton College, Toronto. This academic path helped me strengthen my skills in UI/UX design, API integration, and database management, while working on diverse and challenging projects.
Beyond code, I have a keen eye for design, a love for clean UI, and a passion for creating meaningful digital experiences. I believe in continuous learning and always stay updated with emerging web technologies.
Whether it’s collaborating on a team project, debugging tricky code, or building something from scratch, I bring commitment, creativity, and curiosity to every task.</p>
        <p>
          I’m currently seeking opportunities to contribute to innovative projects and grow as a developer. If you’re looking for a dedicated team player with a passion for technology, let’s connect!
